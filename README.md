A faithful recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game built with Python and Pygame, featuring smooth animations, particle effects, and authentic gameplay mechanics.


### Gameplay
Navigate your bird through an endless series of green pipes by tapping the spacebar to flap and stay airborne. Each pipe you pass increases your score - but be careful, one wrong move and it's game over!
